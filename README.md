For all things Drupal Intranets in the Agency.
This repository was created by Json Marruffo and mostly held together by luck.
## Welcome
The best place to get started within this repository is to understand what you are trying to do. You are currently viewing the README.md file in this repository. Check out the repository's GitHub site pages at https://jmarruff.github.io/Drupal-Intranets for a more familiar view. If you're just starting out with a local site within your region for a particular program **OR** start an entirely new [Drupal](http://drupal.org) project, this is the place for you. If you're looking for immediate support for a project, this is **not** the place for you as contributors are not actively monitoring the issue queue with snappy turnaround times. We want to help, but we cannot guarantee a rapid response. @jmarruff is dedicated to getting the repository active and continually provide updates as projects develop.
